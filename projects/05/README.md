# Chapter 5: Computer Architecture

## Overview

The **von Neumann machine** is a practical model that informs the construction of almost all computer platforms today. At the heart of this architecture lies the **stored program** concept: the computer's memory stores not only the data that the computer manipulates but also the instructions that tell the computer what to do. A von Neumann machine contains the following components:

- **Memory (RAM)**
  - *Data memory:* stores data and allows reading/writing.
  - *Instruction memory:* stores the instructions of an executable.
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
  - *Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):* handles fundamental computations such as addition and bitwise operations.
  - *Registers:* high-speed and expensive memory that prevents starvation.
    - data registers
    - address registers
    - program counter
    - instruction register
  - *Control Unit:* a binary decoder that decodes instructions into micro-codes.
- **Input and Output (I/O)**
  - *Memory-maped I/O:* create a binary emulation of the I/O device, making it appear to the CPU as if it were a regular linear memory segment.
