# nand2tetris

**"nand2tetris"** (From Nand to Tetris) is a collection of projects that let student **build a computer from scratch**. It is a hands-on journey that starts with the most elementary logic gate, called **Nand**. and ends up, 12 projects later, with a **general-purpose computer system capable of running Tetris**. Specifically, the 12 projects are:

1. [Boolean Logic](https://github.com/ret2basic/From-Nand-to-Tetris/tree/main/projects/01)
2. [Boolean Arithmetic](https://github.com/ret2basic/From-Nand-to-Tetris/tree/main/projects/02)
3. [Memory](https://github.com/ret2basic/From-Nand-to-Tetris/tree/main/projects/03)
4. [Machine Language](https://github.com/ret2basic/From-Nand-to-Tetris/tree/main/projects/04)
5. [Computer Architecture](https://github.com/ret2basic/From-Nand-to-Tetris/tree/main/projects/05)
